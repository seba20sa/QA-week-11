# Week 11
**Version 1.0.0**
--
On this asignment we had to create a backend  server that works with the forms developed the previous week.

---
## REGISTER
The register form has a a function, that generates an  request that with the post method, this creates a json file with the data for the valid user.

---
## LOGIN
The login function takes the inputs from the form, sends the data via a json object and then on the backend the handler compares if the inputs that came from the login form match the ones that came from the register one. Depending on the result we get a confirmation for a login or an error message on the console.
